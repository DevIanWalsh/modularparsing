    <h1>Automating Semantic Lexicon Drift</h1>
<p>    "Google has focused on the parsing of text and their relationship-by-associations to semantic contexts. A 'simple' example of this at work is the methodology they've employed when responding to varying search queries from their users. While the harvesting of user data to streamline contextual results catalogued from the user's history, location and browsing habits will obviously mitigaze 'semantic drift' per user, their current algorithim has been developed in tandem with SEO manipulation."
